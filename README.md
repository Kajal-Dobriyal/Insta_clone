# 📸 Instagram Profile Clone

This is a **simple Instagram profile page clone** created by using:

- **HTML** for structure  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** for switching between tabs like Posts, Reels, and Tagged  
- **Yarn** to help compile Tailwind CSS

---

## 🔨 How to Built It

I made this project as practice to improve my skills:

1. Designed the layout using HTML and Tailwind CSS
2. Used JavaScript to create working tabs (like the real Instagram)
3. Used Yarn to compile my Tailwind CSS using the `output.css` file
4. Added sample images for profile and posts
